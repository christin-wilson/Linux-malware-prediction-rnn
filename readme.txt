In this project, we predict whether or not an executable is malicious based on a short snapshot of behavioural data.

The main contributions of this project are:
1) To demonstrate that use recurrent neural networks can predict malicious executable Linux files using machine activity data with good accuracy
2) To demonstrate that Linux executable can be predicted as malicious or not with high level of accuracy using machine learning algorithms.

In this project, we have demonstrated that RNN can be used in predicting Linux malware with 91% accuracy.

A small version of the dataset has been added to this repo.
The entire dataset with 10581 columns are available upon request.
